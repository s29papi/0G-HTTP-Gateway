Perfect — here’s a polished markdown summary, written in the same technical tone and structure as your OG Gateway example, but describing the **browser-based IndexedDB caching extension** we just built:

# 🧠 Technical Delivery — OG Gateway + Browser Caching (MetaLayer Integration)

## 🧠 Key Insight

Instead of downloading OG files to disk or storing them in a temp folder, this system makes **the browser the storage node**.
The IndexedDB-backed cache gives users direct, persistent access to decentralized data — with zero backend persistence.

This creates a **true hybrid** between decentralized storage and client-side persistence:
fast, offline-ready, and directly accessible through a simple browser URL.

## Overview

The **OG Gateway + Browser Cache** is an enhanced version of the OG stateless gateway, designed to make **decentralized OG content directly viewable and persistently stored inside the browser** — without saving files to disk or re-fetching from the network.

It combines:

* The **MetaLayer-powered OG Gateway** (Express backend for streaming decentralized files)
* A **browser client (video-player.html)** that downloads, caches, and replays files entirely from **IndexedDB**
* An optional **service worker (sw-chunked.js)** to support **offline playback** and **progressive chunk caching**

This approach moves OG data closer to users — stored directly inside their browser’s local storage, accessible instantly, even offline.

## ⚙️ Core Accomplishments

* **Client-Side Persistence with IndexedDB:**
  Files fetched from the OG Gateway are saved in the user’s browser using IndexedDB, allowing **replay without re-downloading**.

* **Offline Playback (Service Worker):**
  With `sw-chunked.js`, fetched chunks are cached progressively, allowing offline viewing of previously fetched OG files.

* **Hash-Based Access Model:**
  Users simply visit `/0x<rootHash>` — the gateway serves a dynamic HTML player that fetches and displays content tied to that root hash.

* **Zero Server Writes:**
  The backend never stores permanent data; caching happens entirely in-memory or within the browser — preserving statelessness.

* **Dynamic MIME Handling:**
  The backend and client both use `MetaLayer` metadata and file extensions to determine playback type (video, image, text, etc.).

* **Full Range + Streaming Support:**
  Compatible with HTTP range requests for efficient playback and streaming of large media files.

* **Cross-Origin Compatibility:**
  The gateway sets permissive CORS headers, allowing browser fetches and service workers to access data directly.

## 🧩 Design Decisions

| Component             | Role                                | Reasoning                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **OG Gateway**        | Streams files from the 0G Indexer   | Efficient HTTP interface to decentralized storage     |
| **video-player.html** | Browser UI for playback and caching | User-friendly way to interact with decentralized data |
| **IndexedDB**         | Persistent client-side storage      | Enables replays without refetching                    |
| **Service Worker**    | Background cache handler            | Enables offline access and chunked caching            |
| **MetaLayer Client**  | On-chain metadata resolution        | Derives MIME types and context from OGFileCtx         |
| **Stateless Design**  | No backend persistence              | Keeps gateway lightweight and scalable                |

## 🧠 How It Works

```
Browser (video-player.html)
   ↓ fetches via HTTP
OG Gateway (Express + MetaLayer)
   ↓ resolves metadata
0G Indexer → OG Storage Nodes
```

1. **User Access:**
   The user visits `/0x<rootHash>` or enters a root hash in the browser page.
   The gateway dynamically serves `video-player.html` with that root hash injected.

2. **Download & Cache:**
   The client fetches `/api/v1/storage/:rootHash`, streams the file, and stores it in **IndexedDB**.

3. **Replay (Offline):**
   On reload or offline mode, the client retrieves the blob directly from IndexedDB (or the service worker cache) and renders it instantly.

4. **Stateless Backend:**
   The Express gateway only proxies and streams — no files are permanently written server-side.

## 💻 Example Usage

### 1️⃣ Start the Gateway

```bash
yarn ts-node src/gateway.ts
```

### 2️⃣ Open in Browser

```
http://127.0.0.1:5133/0xda5255f73287096e526638ea0ebc036c5a52d5fbd73c56a20e795e78e7a22735
```

### 3️⃣ In the Page

* Click **“Download & Cache”** → file fetched and stored in IndexedDB
* Click **“Play Blob”** → file is played directly from local storage
* Reload → still playable without fetching again

## 🏁 Outcome

The **OG Gateway + Browser Caching Layer** delivers the full vision of a **web-native decentralized data experience**:

✅ Instant in-browser playback
✅ Persistent local storage
✅ Offline access
✅ No local OG node required
✅ Fully stateless backend

It turns OG’s decentralized storage into **a user-facing, browser-cached web experience** — the foundation for decentralized applications that feel just as responsive and reliable as traditional web apps.
